Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe-Python**, a simple yet fun implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. Challenge the computer in a battle of wits where you play as `O`, and the computer plays as `X`.  

---

## Features  
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enter your moves via a user-friendly console interface.  
- **Smart AI Opponent**: The computer makes random but valid moves.  
- **Visually Clear Board**: The board is displayed with a neat and readable design.  
- **Error Handling**: Invalid or duplicate moves are handled gracefully.

## How to Play  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tic-Tac-Toe-Python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe-Python
   ```
3. Run the game:  
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```
4. The computer starts the game with its move in the center. You can pick your move by entering a number (1-9) corresponding to the board position:  

   ```
   +-------+-------+-------+
   |   1   |   2   |   3   |
   +-------+-------+-------+
   |   4   |   5   |   6   |
   +-------+-------+-------+
   |   7   |   8   |   9   |
   +-------+-------+-------+
   ```

---

## Rules  
- Players take turns placing their symbols (`O` for you, `X` for the computer) on the board.  
- The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.  
- If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Example Gameplay  
Here's an example of the board during gameplay:  

```
+-------+-------+-------+
|   X   |       |       |
+-------+-------+-------+
|       |   O   |       |
+-------+-------+-------+
|       |       |       |
+-------+-------+-------+
```
